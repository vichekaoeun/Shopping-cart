# Shopping Cart
This is a simple shopping cart React project I built to learn React.
## Implementation
**API**: it fetches data from https://fakestoreapi.com/ to provide the product images, product prices and product names
**Routes**: I created routes between the home page and shopping page
**States & Effect**: I used states to update changes within components and props share component states
**Styling**: it uses regular CSS
**Host**: I use Vercel to host the website
